# RR COURSE - 'QA Automation Testing' - 14th WEEK PROJECT

The objective of this week is to use the [Swag Labs](https://www.saucedemo.com/) website as a test base, there we will perform automated e2e tests with the WebdriverIO framework.

## What is Webdriver.IO?

WebdriverIO is a progressive automation framework built to automate modern web and mobile applications. It simplifies the interaction with your app and provides a set of plugins that help you create a scalable, robust and stable test suite.

### It is designed to be:

- Extendable: Adding helper functions, or more complicated sets and combinations of existing commands is simple and really useful.

- Compatible: WebdriverIO can be run on the WebDriver Protocol for true cross-browser testing as well as Chrome DevTools Protocol for Chromium based automation using Puppeteer.

- Feature Rich: The huge variety of built-in and community plugins allows you to easily integrate and extend your setup to fulfill your requirements.

You can use WebdriverIO to automate:

- üåê: modern web applications written in React, Vue, Angular, Svelte or other frontend frameworks

- üì±: hybrid or native mobile applications running in an emulator/simulator or on a real device

- üíª: native desktop applications (e.g. written with Electron.js)
